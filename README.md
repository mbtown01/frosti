# FROSTI

FROSTI (Financially Responsive Open-Source Thermostat Initiative) is a
Raspberry Pi powered open source software + hardware thermostat that can
respond to changes in power price with changes in temperature settings.

## Overview

FROSTI is yet another Python-based, Raspberry Pi powered thermostat, with the
added twist that [GoGriddy](https://www.gogriddy.com/) customers can vary 
temperature targets based on the current cost of electricity.
