FROSTI (the Financially Responsive Open-Source Thermostat Initiative) is a
Raspberry Pi-based thermostat that monitors the local spot market for power
and changes temperature targets to minimize power usage during periods of
high prices.

Today, FROSTI only works with [GoGriddy](https://www.gogriddy.com/), but can
be extended in the future for other markets where end-users are billed.
