To do list
    * Refactor services and move away from singletons
    * think about how we can prevent short cycles on the thermostat
    * new parameters
        * How long to run the fan after cool
        * Shortest cycle time?  
    * Change the fake fan mode into real fan mode after cooling/heating
    * Reset the screen every now and then to fix garbage character issue?!?!
    * in service mode, don't add the timestamp
        * Note that terminal mode on mac has timestamps, Linux does NOT
    * Integrate influx support directly into the runtime
        * Runs on thread, handles exceptions gracefully
        * Adds to influx at events, data samples, etc
    * For a thermostat configuration
        * Should _default be a keyword?
        * Can _default have power overrides?
    * ISSUE! Thermostat starts up in cooling mode?!?!



Thoughts on board v3
    * Include the heat sink for the voltage regulator and 
      move somewhere not under the RPI?
    * Include LEDs for each relay for debugging purposes
    * Add BMP280 circuit directly to the board
    * Scratch Common GPIO 19
    * Scratch all common connections between relays
    * Route GPIO 17, 27, 22 for relays
    * Indicator for power spike / shutdown
    * Replace relays with only-open-when-voltage-applied
