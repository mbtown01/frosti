To do list
    * think about how we can prevent short cycles on the thermostat
    * new parameters
        * How long to run the fan after cool
        * Shortest cycle time?  
    * Reset the screen every now and then to fix garbage character issue?!?!
    * When running as a service, don't add the timestamp
        * Note that terminal mode on mac has timestamps, Linux does NOT
    * Integrate influx support directly into the runtime
        * Adds to influx at events, data samples, etc
        * RUns local on the pi
        * Logs everything important
            * sensor data
            * state changes
            * mode changes
            * price changes
            * settings/temperature targets
    * For a thermostat configuration
        * Should _default be a keyword?
        * Can _default have power overrides? 
    * Debug mode for a thermostat that is deployed
        * physical switch?
        * Setting to not toggle relays no matter what??
    * Integrate system health
        * temperature -- vcgencmd measure_temp
        * load


Thoughts on board v3
    * Include LEDs for each relay for debugging purposes
    * Indicator LED for power spike / shutdown
    * Replace relays with only-open-when-voltage-applied
    * Shrink board and connect w/ ribbon cable or flip so zero hangs off top
    * Change screw terminals to something that can be easily unplugged

Ready to build the rest when...
    * Solved the LCD display going bad issue 
    * Built a case for the unit to hang on the wall
