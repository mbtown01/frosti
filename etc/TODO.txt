To do list
    * Refactor services and move away from singletons
    * think about how we can prevent short cycles on the thermostat
    * new parameters
        * How long to run the fan after cool
        * Shortest cycle time?  
    * Change the fake fan mode into real fan mode after cooling/heating
    * Reset the screen every now and then to fix garbage character issue?!?!
    * When running as a service, don't add the timestamp
        * Note that terminal mode on mac has timestamps, Linux does NOT
    * Integrate influx support directly into the runtime
        * Adds to influx at events, data samples, etc
        * RUns local on the pi
        * Logs everything important
            * sensor data
            * state changes
            * mode changes
            * price changes
            * settings/temperature targets
    * For a thermostat configuration
        * Should _default be a keyword?
        * Can _default have power overrides? 
    * Debug mode for a thermostat that is deployed
        * physical switch?
        * Setting to not toggle relays no matter what??
    * Integrate system health
        * temperature -- vcgencmd measure_temp
        * load
    


Thoughts on board v3
    * Include the heat sink for the voltage regulator and 
      move somewhere not under the RPI?
    * Include LEDs for each relay for debugging purposes
    * Add BMP280 circuit directly to the board
    * Fix for relay wiring
        * Scratch Common GPIO 19
        * Scratch all common connections between relays
        * Route GPIO 17, 27, 22 for relays
    * Indicator LED for power spike / shutdown
    * Replace relays with only-open-when-voltage-applied
    * Add a fan to move air across the sensor
    * Shrink board and connect w/ ribbon cable
    * Add capacitors (w/ resistance) to stablize LCD power
