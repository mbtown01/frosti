Physical
    * All implementations of interfaces with physical associations to Hardware
         -- hated to call this 'hardware' because it was too generic
         -- naming things is hard
    * Should be kept very simple, difficult to test this layer
 
Settings
    * holds all the user-provided settings 
    * available to testing

Driver 
    * uses Sensor to monitor temperature
    * uses Hardware to toggle relays
    * uses Display to reflect current state
    * uses Settings to get the temperature targets
    * runs the loop and responds to changes in temperature
    * publically exposes Thermostat informaiton
        * get() for all sensors
        * get()/set() for temperature targets

Threaded EventHandlers
    * Threaded event handlers are designed to run in the background independent
      of what's going on in the application, and communicate state information
      via events on the EventBus
