Physical
    * All implementations of interfaces with physical associations to Hardware
         -- hated to call this 'hardware' because it was too generic
         -- naming things is hard
    * Should be kept very simple, difficult to test this layer
 
Settings
    * holds all the user-provided settings 
    * available to testing

Driver 
    * uses Sensor to monitor temperature
    * uses Hardware to toggle relays
    * uses Display to reflect current state
    * uses Settings to get the temperature targets
    * runs the loop and responds to changes in temperature
    * publically exposes Thermostat informaiton
        * get() for all sensors
        * get()/set() for temperature targets

Threaded EventHandlers
    * Threaded event handlers are designed to run in the background independent
      of what's going on in the application, and communicate state information
      via events on the EventBus

Thoughts on board v3
    * Include the heat sink for the voltage regulator and 
      move somewhere not under the RPI?
    * Include LEDs for each relay for debugging purposes
    * Add BMP280 circuit directly to the board
    * Scratch Common GPIO 19
    * Scratch all common connections between relays
    * Route GPIO 17, 27, 22 for relays
    * Indicator for power spike / shutdown
    * Replace relays with only-open-when-voltage-applied
