# Summary

This is intended as a reference model of the Raspberry Pi Zero version 1.3 (the one with the camera connector).

Use this model in your 3d modeler of choice as a virtual place holder for the real thing.  I've tried to be accurate enough that the first print off of a properly calibrated printer will fit a physical Raspberry Pi Zero.  There are a number of capacitors that were not added to the model that are higher off of the PCB than the other components, so if you are using this to create an aluminum case that will be in contact with the Memory/CPU POP, have the contact extend down to it.

Comments appreciated.

Edit: Noticed that the crystal had some of it's surfaces deleted during saving in Sketchup.  Modified it to be less detailed.  features were sub millimeter in size so...  The over all dimensions should be good enough for arranging clearance.
